# Out in the Garden (The Moon Seems Very Bright)

Life seems very blue, and perhaps you are through with that hue.\
So, you decide to change it to something else. You pour the black into it, but white spills out instead.\
You ask your very self: "Where is this? What am I?"\
Soon, you realize that this is not a place you know.\
This is your inside: your heart, your memories, and your mind.

Move on, and face the creatures of your own.\
Maybe, you have hurt them once. Maybe, you can make amends.

For out in the garden, the moon could be brighter than tonight.
